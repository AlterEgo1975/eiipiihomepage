DONE 1. main - portfolio - carousel
DONE 2. js - scroll menu highlight
DONE (icons were commented out by purpose) 3. main introduction icons section - project
DONE - links did not scroll to proper place

Todo mobile:

1. Tablet (XXXX x 1024) resolutions - personas is broken, as is portfolio carousel

2. Navbar - collapse CSS transmition (animations) do not work on mobile, so the blue->white background change looks bad - maybe should be turned off?

3. Home team section - now it's single photo in a row, which means a lot of scrolling. But 2x photos in row won't fit (or rather name tags won't fit). Decision here needed - we can turn of the names and do 2 or 3 photos without text in row, or we need to make separate mobile object for team section (dropdown?).

4. Home - I turned off all the animations - I think we need something instead there, either static, or part of the animations. But it's OK for now.

Tasks / Checklist for final steps:

- all vh, vw units might seriously mess up layout - ensure that they are ok on strange (desktop windows rescalling) resolutions
- photo miniatures - ensure that they are ok on strange (desktop windows rescalling) resolutions

Closure - ADD BIOS

Future:
1. skill bar animation
2. maybe font in navigation bar might be bigger?
3. portfolio - tech list font
