DONE 1. main - portfolio - carousel
DONE 2. js - scroll menu highlight
DONE (icons were commented out by purpose) 3. main introduction icons section - project
DONE - links did not scroll to proper place

Todo personas:

Photos still have a gap on the bottom on some common desktop resolutions - i mustve overlooked it before. Solution - col division change from 3 to 4? But this would change whole section height, so it's not best.

Todo mobile:

1. Portfolio carousel is still broken on most horizontal mobiles/smartphones (and some XS phones in vertocal - but i expect single fix will fix it all)

2. Navbar - collapse CSS transmition (animations) does not work on mobile, so the blue->white background change looks bad - maybe should be turned off?

3. Home team section - now it's single photo in a row, which means a lot of scrolling. But 2x photos in row won't fit (or rather name tags won't fit). Decision here needed - we can turn of the names and do 2 or 3 photos without text in row, or we need to make separate mobile object for team section (dropdown?).

4. Home - I turned off all the animations - I think we need something instead there, either static, or part of the animations. But it's OK for now.


Personas - Range 992-1820 have a gap under photo
